      <h2> About Us </h2>
      <h3> We are an organization dedicated to building a more personalized relationship with you and your community. In our current environment, it is more noticeable than ever that we have a wealth   gap that increases quite steadily. The ongoing pandemic has not been beneficial either and has impacted many     minorities of low income the most. In a time where the number of people who need help increases every day,       donating to charity must become more than sending a check to an organization. Now more than ever, there is a     demand for us as a society to be more empathetic towards our neighbors. If our local communities struggle, the   solution to getting past this pandemic will grow further away. "Hello World" is dedicated to creating            healthier relationships and sustainability with peoples of low income, and their community.</h3><br><br>

            <p class = "title">By focusing on providing the best user experience possible, Donationship has earned a trusted brand name. Unfortunately, unscrupulous people sometimes try to use the Google brand to scam and defraud others. Here are a few common scams, and ways that you can avoid and report them.<br><br> GOLDEN RULES:<br><br>

                    1. Slow it down - Scams are often designed to create a sense of urgency. Take time to ask questions and think it through.<br> <br>
                    2. Spot check - Do your research to double check the details you are getting. Does what they’re telling you make sense?<br> <br>
                    3. Stop! Don’t send - No reputable person or agency will ever demand payment or your personal information on the spot.</p>
